### project description
<p>The means to reach out and communicate with family and friends around the world are much greater than they have ever been. With the use of mobile telephones and through constant connection to the internet, our availability and presence within our surrounding networks become continuous. As we draw sentiments of our own existence from others’ perceptions, we remain outside of ourselves. Therefore, spatially speaking, our self-love is a form of self-estrangement.
“me” is an interdisciplinary interactive work combining dance movement, visual art and Kinect cameras. Based on the notions of isolation, identity and narcissism, “me” looks at a world where technology is being designed to allow people to communicate more openly and individually. As we become more and more active on social media and forums we are carefully constructing images of ourselves - selves that we wish to be or are a reflection of. Reactions of others to our self-portrayal is recognition of others affirming ones self-distorted objectified identity establishing one's self-esteem and self-love. As the concept of reality becomes blurred between online and offline, what shades of ourself define our identity? A feeling of safety is created in online communities. It is a pleasure that comes from the instant gratification or familiarity that we may need as individuals. Yet this paradox of self-love creates a physical and mental self-estrangement, that asks the question: what are we leaving behind if the virtual self-becomes what we identify with?</p>
